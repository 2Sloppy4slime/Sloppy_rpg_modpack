# SLOPPY RPG 0.0.8
Sloppy RPG  is a magic and adventure focused minecraft modpack. 

In your infinite greed, you wake up with the terrible urge get the fabled gilded glory armor, to do this, you must complete the biggest adventure of your life!
## Quests
The quest system is a little unique since it doesn't use FTBquests, no giant quest trees that are overwhelming, quests now appear whenever you do specific related actions! it is possible to miss out on a mod through this but it serves to introduce people to them gradually. most quests will be more "tutorial" oriented to help new players to understand how mods work but some will be checklist based, with completionist special quests for the more obsessed players (tbd)
You will most likely be sucked into a questline. Following quests of a certain mod until you're bored of it, in which case you can just do other quests at the time.
## Movement
This modpack uses sQuake, a movement mod that allows for bunny hopping and sharking. this makes some aspects of the game easier while others get more difficult, this is toggleable through the semicolon button. (or at least the semicolon on an azerty layout)
[here is a demonstration of me using it alongside the nether shotgun (that can knock you back)](https://youtu.be/8LjTiuoKrrQ)
## Magic
We have 4 kinds of magic in this modpack :
- Hex casting: a very complicated system where you need to draw your spells yourself, think of it like programming your spells
- Hexalia : a nature based magic mod, plant flowers to gain great effects, control the weather with dolls, do rituals of harvest.
- MM series : a rather straightforward, combat focused mod that mainly uses spellbooks to give you advantages in fights.
- Archon : elemental based magic, bosses, unique tools. this mod can be very useful.

## Experience
The mod aims to personnaliize the way you play minecraft to best fit yourself, this means that we have a lot of different types of armor, weapons and stuff to play the way YOU like. And while this may feel overwhelming, we try to make the experience as smooth as possible. hence why the quest system was done that way. Remember, the goal might be to get the amazing armor, but what's really important is to have fun!!
